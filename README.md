# Developing for Developers, notes to your future selves, 

an overlooked but super key skill is developing your code with future developers in mind.  It's flashy to build apps that are awesome for end users, and impressive to build apps that run flawlessly on all platforms.  it's less glamorous to write developer-friendly source code, but we think it's just as important.

this little gem is designed to get you thinking of your source code as a finished application intended for developers to interact with.

## Developers are Communicators

Programmers write code, developers communicate.  We believe there are enough programmers in the world, but there can never be enough developers. 

Software developers, especially in small to medium sized companies, are responsible for far far more than finished code.  They sit in a key position between customers, marketers, designers, managers, deployment machines, and each other.  At the end of the day it is their responsibility to ensure that there is a working application which fits the end user's needs, deploys smoothly on the necessary platforms, and is scalable and maintainable.  Writing code and developing fly algorithms is only a small part of this job description.

We believe the most important skill a developer can have is strong communication - throughout the development process, but also through their completed source code. 

Source code is a developers final product.  After hours of planning, emailing, testing, coding, and getting stuck on bugs all that's left is the source code and there's no guarantee that you'll be the one to maintain that code.  This means it's crucial for developers to embed everything they know about the project directly into their finished source code. Completed source code is the most powerful tool available for developers to communicate the intention of their project. 

Your finished code needs to communicate directly to 3 very different, and equally important audiences:
1. End Users must understand why they're using your software and how to use it
2. Developers must understand how to test, maintain, expand, and re-use your code
3. Deployment Environments must recieve carefully tuned compiled projects

At Elewa Academy, we like to think about number 2 a lot.  There are many tools, libraries, and learning resources for UI and UX.  There is also an over abundance of tools, libraries and learning resources to learn how to develop for any platform or deployment environment.  We know of very few resources that attempt to teach beginner and intermediate developers how to communicate with each other across space and time - reading and writing meaningful source code.

The remainder of this repository is an introduction to how to develope for developers, shaping your source code itself into a meaningful tool for future developers working on your project. We hope it helps you out no matter where you are on your learning journey, and no matter what programming stack you're learning.

All the best

The team at Elewa
