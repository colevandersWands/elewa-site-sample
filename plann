message
	intro - 3 audiences
	depth - dev audience
		- "source code should be an application, working code is not always finished code.  UI is the repo, UX is the function calls"
		UX 
			trustable
				tests and testable
			usable
				code "surface" is intuitive
			understandable
				make your reasoning clear
				make your code readable
				provide levels of readability
			maintainable
				everything above again
				modular
		UI
			layers of accessibility in the repo
				- each layer should serve a purpose
				- someone wishing for that purpose should need to go no deeper
				repository/readme
				branches/releases/commits
				documentation/tests
				files/folders
				variable names
				logic itself
		make your github your portfolio



audience
	interested student
	no experience in code necessary
	someone trying to understand our core message


structure
	a click-navigable repository - walk the walk
	|- readme
	|	+ coding is communication, the three audiences, this focuses on the developer audience, how to navigate this repo, index
	|- developing for developers
	|	+ more time reading and maintaining than writing (coding horror articles), source code is an application for other developers
	|- source code UI
	|	+ see notes in "message"
	|- source code UX
	|	+ see notes in "message"
	|- challenge
		+ take some working code of yours and make it such a repo, examples (lodash, express, https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows, ** https://github.com/SkyHacks/nerds **)(of course there is some extra convention to understanding these repos)
